    <h3 id="secondHeaderThree">One of my favorite hobbies:</h3>
    <p id="secondParagraph">My favorite hobby is playing video games. Although I do not play them nearly as much as I used to due to being kept busy with school, work, family matters, and other things I still really enjoy winding down whenever I have my own free time and playing online with some friends. Not only can I stay in touch with them without having to see them, but since I was a kid I have always been interested in the work put into them. When I am not playing with friends I enjoy a single player game since it will forever fascinate me how despite it only being on a screen it can be so immersive. I genuinely enjoy a well written story in a video game and personally I consider them to be on par with other forms of media such as books and movies. </p>
