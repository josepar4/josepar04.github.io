    <h1>Welcome to My Personal Website</h1>
    <h3>What can you expect from this:</h3>
    <p>Here on this website you will be able to learn about me, see the current status of my resume, and have a way to contact me through email. Hopefully learning about me can make it easier to connect or relate to me in any way. As for my resume, not only is its purpose to see my progress, but to also compare mine to yours and see where we both are. For any questions or to simply reach out and have a talk, the "Contact Me" page should make it easier for you.
